# User Guide: How to Use the Government GitHub Analysis System

1. Set Up Your Environment
Before using the system, ensure that you're running the notebook in a Google Colab environment or
a local Jupyter Notebook with internet access. You must have a .env file with the following
environment variables properly set:
ini


CopyEdit

ENDPOINT=<your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL>
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your deployment name, e.g., gpt-4o>
SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI subscription key>
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your GitHub personal access token>
Make sure the .env file is located in the same directory as your notebook, and that it is loaded
using load_dotenv().


2. Fetch GitHub Government Accounts

The system will automatically fetch a YAML file from GitHub that lists hundreds of official
government GitHub accounts worldwide. This file is maintained by GitHub itself and provides the
foundation for analysis.
You can choose to:
• Analyze all accounts (default: off), or
• Filter by selected high-impact organizations like GSA, alphagov, or opengovsg by
setting USE_FILTERED_ACCOUNTS = True.


3. Extract Repository Metadata

The system then fetches:
• Repository names
• Descriptions
• Number of stars and forks
• Main programming language
• README file contents (truncated for quick processing)
This data is stored and prepared for AI-powered analysis.


4. Run AI-Powered Summarization and Sentiment Analysis
For each README file:

• A summary is generated using GPT-4o, condensing the project’s main goal.
• A sentiment score (positive, neutral, or negative) is derived to understand how clearly and
confidently the project is presented.
This is done using Azure’s OpenAI service through LangChain’s AzureChatOpenAI
integration.


5. Export Analysis Results
All results are saved to the following files:

• readme_analysis.csv: Summary and sentiment per project
• readme_analysis.json: Same content in JSON format
• sentiment_by_country.csv: Aggregated sentiment by country
• sentiment_by_org.csv: Aggregated sentiment by organization
You can find these files in your Colab file browser (Files tab on the left). Right-click and
download as needed.
Expected Outcomes of the Analysis
This system is designed to support strategic decision-making about public-sector technology
investments. Here’s what you can expect:
• Summarized Project Overviews: Concise summaries of each open-source government
project to help non-technical reviewers quickly grasp each project’s purpose.
• Sentiment Evaluation: Tone-based insights that help evaluate how professional,
enthusiastic, and well-articulated each README is—an indirect measure of project quality
and clarity.
• Trend Analysis: Identify which countries or organizations are producing the most positively
received projects, allowing policymakers or investors to focus on regions of innovation.
• Opportunity Identification: The system helps highlight standout projects (like Singapore’s
AskGov) that are worth funding, replicating, or integrating into broader civic technology
initiatives.
• Data-Driven Insights: Rather than relying on subjective judgment, the system offers AI-
supported, reproducible insights based on actual project content and presentation.
